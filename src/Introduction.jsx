            <b>Personal Background: </b>I was born in New Brunswick, NJ, but I
            spent most of my life in Concord, NC. I still live in Concord with
            my parents.{" "}

            <b>Academic Background: </b> I went to Cox Mill Elementary, Harris
            Road Middle, and Cox Mill High school. I started my college career
            in Appalachian State University studying music production, moved to
            CPCC for financial reasons, then changed my major to Computer
            Science and eventually ended up pursuing a degree closer to home in
            UNCC.

            <b>Courses I'm Taking & Why</b>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>MATH1242 - Calculus 2: </b>This is required for my major, but
                I am interested in continuing my math studies to work towards a
                math minor.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>ITSC3146 - Intro to Operating Sys. & Networking</b> I am very
                interested in operating systems. I would like what I learn in
                this class to create some personal projects.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>ITIS3200 - Intro to Info Security and Privacy: </b>This class
                very closely relates to one of my dream occupations: creating
                and maintaining cybersecurity measures for a public database,
                like online libraries.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>ITIS3135 - Front-End Web App Development: </b>I figure that
                concepts in this course are essential to know for anyone that
                wants to create a nice portfolio for computer science.
